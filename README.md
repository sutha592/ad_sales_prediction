## 📈 Dataset

The dataset includes columns:
- `TV` – advertising budget spent on TV
- `Radio` – budget spent on radio ads
- `Newspaper` – budget spent on newspaper ads
- `Sales` – sales outcome

This dataset is a standard example used for regression analysis, often seen in marketing analytics tutorials.

---

## 📌 Results

- The Linear Regression model demonstrated a good fit with R² score and MAE/MSE metrics.
- Feature importance showed that TV and Radio budgets had the most influence on sales prediction.
